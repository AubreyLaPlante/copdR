</h2>
<p>In general, when scientists are trying to determine the size of past
earthquakes, they need to know how much slip occurred in a single
earthquake. This is because the magnitude of total offset is correlated
to the moment magnitude/energy released during an earthquake (e.g., the
Richter Scale). To determine the amount of total offset that occurs
during earthquakes, we must find linear features that intersect the
surface trace of a fault, and reconstruct the feature by ‘backslipping’
or undoing the motion that deformed that originally-linear feature.
There are fantastic historic examples of roads and fences being split
apart by earthquakes, but we may also use naturally sub-linear geologic
features such as glacier moraines, streams, and ridges.</p>

</h3>
<p>Southeastern California has many examples of well-exposed linear
features, or ‘piercing points’ that we can reconstruct. In Figure 1, a
single point bar is right-laterally offset by a single fault trace.</p>

<p>Assuming that this was one feature originally, we can measure how
much one side of the bar moved relative to the other by measuring the
distance between the southern edge of the western bar segment and the
southern edge of the eastern bar segment. We can also measure the
distance between the northern edge of the western bar segment and the
northern edge of the eastern bar segment. There is also the crest of the
bar, representing its maximum height at a central E-W axis, that
provides another lateral offset measurement. As you might imagine, there
is considerable uncertainty within where these bar edges and crest lines
are, and this can change the measured lateral offset of this feature,
depending on scientific interpretations. Confused yet?</p>

<p>What Figure 2d shows is that when we estimate the amount of slip on a
fault from an offset feature by ‘backslipping’ that feature, we get a
most-likely value (where correlation = 1), bounded by a maximum and a
minimum slip value (where correlation = 0). This curve approximates a
normal/Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF) where the width
of this distribution is related to the uncertainty of the offset
measurement. We can quantify that uncertainty in a number of ways
including the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation, or
confidence scaling. Confidence scaling can vary across different
scientific studies, and is used to more-strongly weight the more
sharply-defined piercing points (linear features) when we combine/sum
multiple PDFs together to create a cumulative-offset probability
distribution function.</p>

functions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-cumulative-offset-probability-distribution-copd-functions"></a>
</h2>
<p>First of all, what are cumulative-offset probability distribution
(COPD) functions, and how are they used in earthquake offset analyses?
COPDs are the summed total of all the normal PDFs, across the entire
length of a fault zone. One commonly used example is the well-defined
COPD plots from the Carrizo Plain segment of the San Andreas fault in
California, US. Similar to the example shown above in Figure 2, Zielke
et al., (2010) illustrates one example of right-lateral offset of a
single drainage. In this example, the PDF peak occurs at around 5 m,
with an uncertainty of ± ~0.6 - 0.7 m.</p>

<p>Zielke et al., (2010) then combines dozens of PDFs along this segment
of the San Andreas fault, as seen in Figure 4.</p>

All PDFs are summed together to create a COPD plot, which is useful in interpreting the magnitude of total slip in past earthquakes. (a) Individual PDFs are plotted in space, with distance from north to south on the X axis and total offset magnitude on the Y axis. PDFs are colored by average slip magnitude, with orange representing the clustering of the least amount of slip and light blue representing the clustering of the largest magnitude of slip. (b) All PDFs are summed together to isolate clusters of total offset magnitudes. Theoretically, each peak represents the displacement associated with a different number of earthquakes, assuming that each earthquake produced the same magnitude of slip. Therefore, orange curves represent one earthquake, purple curves represent two earthquakes, yellow represents three earthquakes, etc. Figure from Zielke et al., (2010)." width="100%"><p class="caption">

<p>This combined/summed PDF plot (Figure 4b) is the cumulative-offset
probability distribution (COPD) function. Each of these individual PDFs
have different local offset maxima because each offset marker records a
different number of earthquakes. This is consistent with what we would
expect, such that the oldest geomorphic features have been displaced by
many earthquakes, while the youngest generations of Holocene alluvium
may have only experienced the most recent earthquake. Assuming that
earthquakes on the southern San Andreas fault are perfectly elastic,
such that this fault repeatedly produces the same size earthquake on the
same size rupture patch in subsequent events, we would also expect to
see regular PDF peak spacing from subsequent earthquakes producing the
same total magnitudes of slip.</p>
<p>In Figure 4b, we see peaks in the COPD plot of 5m, 10m, 15m, and so
on. This is useful, and consistent with our assumptions. It appears that
each earthquake on the Carrizo segment produces about ~5m of
right-lateral strike slip motion. Using this number for average
displacement we can use scaling relationships (Wells and Coppersmith,
1994) to determine that this amount of average displacement corresponds
to a rupture length of ~136 km and an earthquake magnitude of Mw ~7.7.
COPDs can be really useful to estimate future seismic hazards!</p>
